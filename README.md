## Instructions

In order to have a working copy of the code in the book, download the
zip file of this repository and extract the content of the zip file in a
folder of your convenience.

  - The `data` folder contains datasets used in the book, except those
    downloadable from websites, and those that are too large to store on
    GitHub (e.g., the full season Statcast files). In order to get the
    missing datasets, read the `readme.txt` files stored inside the
    `lahman`, `sqldumps` and `wizardry` subfolders of the `data` folder.
  - The `scripts` folder contains standalone R scripts that were
    referenced in the text.
  - The `chapter_code` folder contains all of the code that was written
    to generate each chapter. (e.g., the result of running
    `knitr::purl()` on each of the chapter source files.)
